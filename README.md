# rhythm.2.0
This is my second project for the Athena Award, called Rhythm: Where Sound Becomes Color.
I built it by following a guide by @celesteroselli, then customized it to reflect my own creative style and make it unique.
I chose this project because it beautifully combines art, music, and mathematics, it transforms musical notes into colorful, dynamic waves that move and change with sound, turning any melody into a visual experience.
I spent over 10 hours building and personalizing it using Visual Studio Code. The project is powered by JavaScript, which I used to create functions that make the waves shift in color, change in size, and even record live sounds.
To use this page, just type some letters like A, B, C, D, E, F, or G, and watch how they transform into something beautiful. 
This project represents how I see creativity: as a bridge between logic and emotion, where code and rhythm meet to create something truly alive.
