# rhythm.2.0
This is my second project for the Athena Award Oscillart. I created it following a guide by celesteroselli. I chose to make this project because it transforms musical notes into art colorful waves that change with sound allowing any melody to become something more. I customized it to reflect my own style and make it unique. 
I built this project using Visual Studio Code, where I used JavaScript to create different functions that make the waves colorful, change their size, and even allow them to be recorded.
